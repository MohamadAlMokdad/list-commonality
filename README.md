# **Find Common Elements in Multiple Lists** ðŸ”„

## **Description** ðŸ’¡

This Python script is designed to find the common elements present in **three lists**. It uses a **triple nested loop** to iterate through all elements of the lists, compares them, and returns a new list containing the elements that appear in all three lists.

For example:
- **Input**:
  - `list1`: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
  - `list2`: `[4, 6, 8, 12, 14]`
  - `list3`: `[0, 4, 6, 8, 16]`
- **Output**: `[4, 6, 8]`
